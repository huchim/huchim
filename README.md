### Hi there 👋

![image-20210507131525727](images/cover.png)

Hello, this is **Carlos Huchim Ahumada**

I'm a **software developer** living in **Yucatán, México** and working in [CFE](https://ww.cfe.mx) since 2007. I previously worked in the "Housing reconstruction program for [hurricane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Isidore) victims" leaded by Yucatan Government.

I've been _coding_ since 2000 year :sparkles:

My coding experience was with [VB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic) and [Visual FoxPro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_FoxPro) and I really enjoyed these times.

Most of the time I develop using many languages in backend and frontend

- .NET (C#, VB)
- PHP
- Typescript (:heart: ReactJs & ReactNative)

But I'm also manage some database servers

- MySql (MariaDB :facepunch:)
- Sql Server (2005, 2008, 2012 & 2016)

Basically I can develop a software in server, desktop and mobile and use GitHub (also Gitlab :open_hands: and VisualStudio) to test and deploy applications on servers (Windows, Ubuntu or Alpine).

My hobbies are gardening 🌻, ponds 🐠, and repair cars 🔧🚗.
